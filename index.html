                    <P>Dog is a man’s best friend” is a very common quote that best explains the relationship between
                        man and dog. Dog has been the man’s companion since pre historic stone age. Both share a mutual
                        give and take relationship, where a man feeds a dog in exchange of his services. Dogs are pretty
                        honest to their masters and never ever betray or leave their side, even in most threatening
                        situations.

                        Unlike other domesticated animals dog shares an exceptional emotional bond with its master and
                        his family as well. A dog works as a watchdog, securing the premises of its owner; an alarming
                        dog just in case if any suspicious activity is noted and works also as a playful mate.

                        his family as well.Dog and
                        man share a pre historic relationship and will continue to do so till the last day on earth.</P>
